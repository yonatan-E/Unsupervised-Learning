# Unsupervised Learning: Large Scale Data Analysis

In the following research we used many unsupervised learning techniques to find the hidden relations in large scale data-sets.  
In order to do it, we compared different clustering methods in order to find the optimal number of clusters in the data-sets.  
We also tried to fit the clustering to an external classification, in order to expose hidden relations in the data.  
In addition, we reduced the dimension of the data in order to plot the data and the association between the clusters and the external variables.  
Finally, we found the anomalies in the data and tried to evaluate the association between the anomalies and the external variables.
