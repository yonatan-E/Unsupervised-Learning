# Unsupervised Learning: Large Scale Data Analysis

In the following research we used many unsupervised learning techniques to find the hidden relations in large scale data-sets.

In order to do it, we compared different clustering methods in order to find the methods that best suits the data-set. Next, we tried to fit the clustering to an external classification by maximizing the mutual information.

In addition, we reduced the dimension of the data in order to plot the data and the association between the clusters and the external variables. Finally, we searched for anomalies in the data and measured the association between the anomalies and the external variables.
